Bug Report:
If nextflow.config has a manifest scope it doesn't get filled by the `params` or `env` variables unlike other scopes

Expected Behavior:
Nextflow would parse the parameters and environmental variables and replace them in the manifest scope as it does for other scopes

Steps to reproduce
Run the command:
nextflow run -hub github hydriniumh2/nextflow_parse_issue -latest --foo foo --bar bar --location test -r master

Gives the error:
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 19.04.1
Pulling hydriniumh2/nextflow_parse_issue ...
Fast-forward
Missing project main script: [USER DIRECTORY].nextflow/assets/hydriniumh2/nextflow_parse_issue/[:]/main.nf

But running locally is fine:
nextflow test/main.nf --foo foo --bar bar --location test
